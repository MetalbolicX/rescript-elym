# ResForge

## What problem ResForge solves?

Many developers are eager to try ReScript, but often find themselves spending more time writing external bindings for JavaScript than building their actual applications. ResForge solves this problem for front-end web development by providing a fluent, type-safe API for selecting, manipulating, and managing DOM elementsâ€”so you can focus on building great apps.
